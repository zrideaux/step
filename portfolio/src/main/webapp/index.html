        <h3>Welcome to My Portfolio!</h3>
        <p>Hello! I am a California-based computer science student at UC Irvine with a passion for creating! I have always loved to make things that help or entertain others, meaning that I have had a lot of time to expose myself to a number of creative tools, mediums, and practices.</p>
        <p>On this site, you can find a few examples of my work, read about some of my career experiences, and find some information on where to find me! Here are a few highlights:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>I'm currently serving as a STEP intern at Google! Last year I was chosen to participate in Google's CSSI program.</li> 
          <li>I've created videos and graphics for livestreamers which have drawn millions of views.</li> 
        </ul>
        <p>Check out the Projects and Experience tabs to learn about my work in more detail!</p>

        <p>I was chosen to participate in Google's Computer Science Summer Institute program in the summer of 2019! During CSSI I was able to work with a host of Googlers to become familiar with several technologies crucial to web development. I also got the opportunity to work with a small team to create an original webapp and experienced Google culture for the first time!</p>
